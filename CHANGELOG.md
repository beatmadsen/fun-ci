## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- Multi-line ASCII art header animations for pipeline events (explosion on failure, celebrations on success)
- Looping idle starfield animation in the TUI header
- Rocket animation while pipelines are running, with flickering exhaust and parallax starfield
- HeaderAnimationManager with idle/running/event state transitions
- AnimationLibrary with 8 animation data files (explosion, success, celebrate, flash, leprechauns, yay, idle, running)

### Fixed
- Footer animations now display 8x slower so text is actually readable
- Animation refresh no longer blocks for 5 seconds between frames when no pipelines are running
- Removed stale single-line header banner that conflicted with multi-line animations
- Animation frames padded to global max width across all frames, preventing horizontal jitter

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- Four-stage local CI pipeline (lint, build, fast, slow) with strict time budgets (30s/30s/10s/5min)
- Unified CLI (`fun-ci`) with subcommands: trigger, console, init, install-hooks, check
- Pre-commit hook (background fork, non-blocking) and pre-push hook (synchronous, blocking)
- TUI dashboard with vim-style navigation (j/k/c/q), pagination, and project path display
- Project scaffolding with built-in templates for Ruby (Bundler), JVM (Gradle Kotlin/Groovy, Maven)
- SQLite persistence with WAL mode for pipeline results
- Parallel lint + build stages with background slow suite
- Smart Maven linter detection for template generation
- Stale pipeline auto-cancellation
